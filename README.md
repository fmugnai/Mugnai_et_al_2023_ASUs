## In this repository you can find the compressed (.gz) fastq files from illumina MiSeq metabarcoding sequencing of ASUs samples from the 2019 SEAMoBB project field sampling.
The metadata guide for the fastq files is as follows:
1. If the sample name starts with "LIV", "PAL", or "ROV" it means that they represents samples from the three target Locations (Livorno, Palinuro and Rovinj, respectively).
2. The following three capital letters represent the sampling sites (one per each location).
3. The 01, 02, 03 information represent each single ASUs replicate per site.
4. The other three digits, two numbers followed by the "F" (e.g., 64F), represents the sample ID: you can ignore this information.
5. The last number in each filename refers to the technical replicate (1, 2, 3) of the multiplex PCRs performed. A mean of reads of these replicates was then calculated and considered for the statistical data analyses.
